    title: "Core Purpose of CascadeFlowVisualizer Library"
    description: `
        The CascadeFlowVisualizer is a React-based library designed to provide an interactive,
        IDE-like visual environment for working with Cascade DSL V1.1 documents.
        Its primary goals are to:
        1. Enable users to intuitively understand the structure, data flow, control flow, and context variable usage within individual flows.
        2. Visualize relationships and dependencies between different flows and modules in a larger system.
        3. Facilitate inspection and editing of DSL configurations using dynamically generated forms based on component schemas.
        4. Provide robust debugging capabilities by visualizing historical flow execution traces, including step statuses and I/O data.
        5. Support property testing by allowing users to define, execute, and visualize test cases against flow definitions.
        6. Offer clear navigation across a distributed system of interconnected flows defined in multiple modules.
