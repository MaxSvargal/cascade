# Cascade Workspace Cleanup Summary

## Overview
The cascade-workspace package has been cleaned up to remove redundant code and files that were replaced by the new `@cascade/client` library package.

## Files Removed

### Deprecated Services
- `src/services/cascadeClient.ts` - Replaced by `@cascade/client` package
- `src/services/cascadeTestServer.ts` - Replaced by `@cascade/client` package

### Deprecated API Endpoints
- `src/app/api/execution/flow/route.ts` - Consolidated into unified `/api/execution` endpoint
- `src/app/api/execution/step/route.ts` - Consolidated into unified `/api/execution` endpoint  
- `src/app/api/execution/[executionId]/route.ts` - Consolidated into unified `/api/execution` endpoint
- `src/app/api/execution/[executionId]/status/route.ts` - Consolidated into unified `/api/execution` endpoint

### Build Artifacts
- `.DS_Store` files - Removed macOS system files
- `tsconfig.tsbuildinfo` - Removed TypeScript build cache
- `.next/` directory - Cleaned Next.js build cache

## Files Updated

### Examples
- `src/examples/unifiedExecutionDemo.ts` - Updated import to use `@cascade/client` instead of local services

## Current API Structure

After cleanup, the API now has a single unified endpoint:
- `POST /api/execution` - Handles all execution operations (flow, step, status, cancel) via action-based routing

## Benefits of Cleanup

1. **Reduced Duplication**: Eliminated duplicate client and server code
2. **Simplified Architecture**: Single API endpoint instead of 4 separate endpoints
3. **Better Maintainability**: Centralized execution logic in `@cascade/client` package
4. **Improved Testing**: Test server is now available as a reusable library
5. **Cleaner Codebase**: Removed unnecessary build artifacts and system files

## Migration Impact

- All existing functionality is preserved
- API interface remains compatible
- Test server capabilities are enhanced
- Client code is more robust and type-safe

## Next Steps

1. Update any external documentation that references the old API endpoints
2. Consider updating any client code to use the new unified client interface
3. Test the unified execution system in development and staging environments
